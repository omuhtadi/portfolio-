                    <h3>Volunteer Experience and Leadership</h3>
                    <p>In 2008 I went to Zambia and Botswana with a charity group called World Challenge. I did 2 weeks of charity work, which included teaching English in primary schools and helping to build/repair camp sites for the local community. I
                        then did 2 weeks of trekking through the mountains/swamps and visiting tourist spots like Victoria falls.</p>
                    <p>I went with a team of 11 people including a world challenge expedition leader. The team took it in turns to be team leader for 2 days each and had to organise camp duties, budget for meals and activities for the 2 days they were in
                        charge and keep the rest of the team on track with the itinerary. The experience I gained was invaluable. At the age of 16 my eyes were opened to the poverty of the 3rd world, I experienced a whole new way of life and culture which
                        I’d never seen before and I gained a new appreciation for the privileged lifestyle we have in the U.K. The experience also taught me team-work, leadership and financial budgeting. </p>
