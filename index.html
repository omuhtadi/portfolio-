                    <p>My name is Omar Muhtadi and I am a 27-year-old student web developer based in Manchester. I am originally from N.Ireland, however I moved to Manchester to pursue a career in Web development. I am currently in my final year studying
                        Information &amp; Communications at Manchester Metropolitan university, and as of May, I will be ready for employment in the industry. When I’m not cooped up in my bedroom doing coursework, you can find me looking at pictures of
                        cute dogs on the internet or playing on my PlayStation; 2 activities that keep me sane. Take a look at my blog posts from the above menu and feel free to get in touch with me via <a href="mailto:omuhtadi@gmail.com">e-mail</a>.</p>
